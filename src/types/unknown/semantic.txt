they are different in semantics.

`unknown` is the parent type of all other types. it's a regular type in the type system.

`any` means "turn off the type check". it's kind of meta programming.



"meta programming" means the word "any" is not the content being compiled,
that's to say, it doesn't tell the compiler what to be compiled.
Instead, it configures the process of compilation, that's to say,
it tells the compiler how to compile
